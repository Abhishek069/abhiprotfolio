                    <h1>Fast Food Management System Report</h1>
                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Fast food management system is an application that helps to manage the entire operations of fast food restaurants such as order processing, inventory management, customer management, and sales management. The system is designed to streamline and automate the operations of fast food restaurants, which in turn helps to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the customer experience. In this report, we will discuss the implementation of a fast food management system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>
                    <h2>System Architecture:</h2>
                    <p>The fast food management system comprises of three main components: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. The front-end is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end is responsible for processing the user requests and generating responses. It is developed using PHP. The database is responsible for storing the data used by the system. It is implemented using MySQL.</p>
                    <h2>User Interface:</h2>
                    <p>The user interface of the fast food management system consists of a web page with various sections. The header section contains the logo, name, and navigation links of the restaurant. The main section contains the menu items with images, descriptions, and prices. Customers can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout. The checkout page contains a form for the customers to enter their details and submit their order. The system sends an order confirmation email to the customer.</p>
                    <h2>Database:</h2>
                    <p>The database of the fast food management system consists of several tables, including the menu items table, the orders table, the customers table, and the inventory table. The menu items table contains the name, description, image, and price of each menu item. The orders table contains the order details, including the customer name, order date, and total amount. The customers table contains the customer details, including the name, email, and phone number. The inventory table contains the stock levels of each menu item.</p>
                    <h2>Backend:</h2>
                    <p>The backend of the fast food management system consists of several PHP scripts that handle the user requests and generate responses. When the user adds an item to the cart, the system updates the cart session variable. When the user submits the order, the system stores the order details in the orders table and updates the inventory levels. The system also sends an order confirmation email to the customer.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>In conclusion, the fast food management system is an essential application for fast food restaurants. It helps to streamline and automate the operations of the restaurant, which in turn increases efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances the customer experience. The system is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, which are popular web development technologies. With further development and enhancements, the system can be customized to meet the specific needs of different fast food restaurants.</p>
